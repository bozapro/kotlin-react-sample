# kotlin-react-sample
This repository provides the source code for the Kotlin-React 
sample app of the article [Getting Started With Kotlin-React](https://medium.com/@ralf.stuckert/getting-started-with-kotlin-react-c5f3b079a8bf).
The app was set up using [create-react-kotlin-app](https://github.com/JetBrains/create-react-kotlin-app)
which scaffolds a runnable app including an IntelliJ project file.

A prebuilt version of the app is hosted on GitHub Pages
https://ralfstuckert.github.io/kotlin-react-sample/

To run it locally, just clone the project and call
* npm install
* npm start
